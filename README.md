## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML CSS Javascript

The game starts when the user press down the spacebar to initiate the game. The goal is to earn points which is accrued as time passes in the game. When the corn collides with the chicken, the user loses the game and is forced to restart. The chicken interval is randomized through a fixed range. In addition, the speed of the game increases at a set fixed rate. 
## Lessons Learned:

In the creation of this app, the objective was to use solely basic javascript, html, and css to create an app since the previous apps created focused on react. The goal was to get re-introduced to the syntax of vanilla javascript and learn from the basics, which led to the creation of this game.
